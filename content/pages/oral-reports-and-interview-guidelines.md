Oral Reports
------------

### Roles of the Audience

One of the purposes of oral reports is to learn how to use Chinese to elaborate your thoughts and engage in meaningful conversations with your classmates. Listeners will be required to ask the presenter one or two questions at the end. Your participation is expected and will be evaluated.

### A Useful Online Dictionary

[Online Chinese-English Talking Dictionary](http://www.yellowbridge.com/chinese/)

(Use the online dictionary with caution. It is recommended to know how the words you need are properly used contextually by consulting your teacher or a native speaker.)

Oral Report 1: 自我介绍 (Zìwŏ Jièshào)
----------------------------------

### Method of Report

1.  Your presentation should be about 3 minutes long.
2.  You are to stand in front of the class. You may quickly look at your notes, but _don't read them_.
3.  Feel free to bring any visual aids as you see fit.

\*When you prepare for your report, focus on both your _accuracy_ and _fluency_. Accuracy refers to your tones, pronunciations and grammar while fluency refers to the smoothness of your presentation.

Final Oral Interview
--------------------

Kubler, Cornelius C. _Basic Spoken Chinese: An Introduction to Speaking and Listening for Beginners_. Tuttle Publishing, 2011. ISBN: 9780804840156.

Materials Coverage: \[BSC\] Unit 6 to Unit 10

### Format

You are going to meet with your instructor individually for 15 minutes. The first 10 minutes are the oral interview and the last 5 minutes are allocated for feedback. The oral interview is composed of two parts—Q&A and role play. In the Q&A, you are expected to respond to your instructor's questions _accurately_ and _fluently_. The questions asked are all related to the topics covered from \[BSC\] Unit 6 to Unit 10. For example:

*   Biographical information
*   Questions about family
*   Getting around in Boston
*   Weather

In the role play, you will be given a task (For example, you are asking your friend from Taiwan about its climate in the summer) situated contextually and you are expected to complete a performance with your teacher.

### Preparation

While we understand that there are many materials to review, we suggest you start with _all_ the sentence patterns in each lesson, followed by going over the conversations and then the vocabulary. Remember, this is an _Oral_ Interview, so always think about how you can use each pattern contextually.
